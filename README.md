# qr scanner program for scouting app
The the xlsx file to be modified should be `scouting.xlsx` in the directory of the python script
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies or `pip3` or whatever you use on your system

1. run `qr.py`
2. you should see your camera
3. scan qr code ( you can scan multiple at a time )
4. press `q` when done scanning
5. yay you are done. If you open the excel sheet you should see the new entries on the top

if you get an error, make sure you don't have the excel file open as it cannot be modified if you have it open
